### Purpose
The OpportunityRankingRound evaluates all standardized market data (from the UnifiedMarketData schema) to identify and rank arbitrage opportunities. The process applies user-defined and algorithmic criteria to select the most promising opportunities for capital allocation.

### Ranking Criteria
- **Net Estimated APY:** Opportunities are ranked by net APY (supply_apy_net - borrow_apy_net - estimated transaction costs).
- **Risk Score:** Incorporates protocol risk, health factor, LTV, and liquidity depth.
- **Liquidity:** Opportunities with higher available liquidity are preferred.
- **User Constraints:** Only opportunities matching user-configured assets, protocols, and risk parameters are considered.
- **Transaction Cost:** Estimated gas and slippage costs are subtracted from net APY.

### Example Ranking Algorithm
```python
# Pseudocode for ranking
ranked = []
for opp in all_possible_opportunities:
    if opp['net_estimated_apy'] < user.min_net_apy:
        continue
    if opp['risk_score'] > user.max_risk_score:
        continue
    if opp['liquidity_usd'] < user.min_liquidity:
        continue
    ranked.append(opp)
ranked.sort(key=lambda x: x['net_estimated_apy'], reverse=True)
```

### Risk Scoring
- **Protocol Risk:** Static score per protocol (e.g., audited, TVL, exploit history).
- **Position Risk:** Health factor, LTV, and volatility.
- **Composite Score:** Weighted sum of protocol and position risk.

### Capital Allocation Logic
- **Allocation per Opportunity:**
  - User can set max allocation per opportunity/protocol.
  - Allocation is the minimum of available capital, protocol cap, and user-configured max.
- **Example:**
```python
allocation = min(user.max_allocation, opp['liquidity_usd'], available_capital)
```
- **Diversification:** Optionally, capital can be split across top-N ranked opportunities.

### Output
- The top-ranked opportunities and their allocations are passed to the TransactionConstructionRound for execution.
- See [ArbitrageOpportunity Schema](../schemas/unified_schema.md) for the data structure used.

## Endpoint Security
- By default, agent endpoints (healthcheck, UI) are not authenticated, as they are only exposed to the local Pearl environment.
- If deploying outside Pearl, consider adding authentication (API keys, JWT, etc).

## Pearl Context
- Pearl manages agent process isolation and network access, so external authentication is not required for standard deployments.

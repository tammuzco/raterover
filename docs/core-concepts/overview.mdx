# Core Concepts Overview

## Agent Purpose
RateRover is an autonomous agent designed to identify and execute profitable DeFi yield arbitrage opportunities on Arbitrum. Its core objective is to automate the full arbitrage lifecycle: data collection, opportunity analysis, transaction execution, and position management, with robust risk controls and extensibility for new protocols and assets.

## Open Autonomy Framework Integration
RateRover is built on the Open Autonomy (OLAS) framework, leveraging its FSM-based agent architecture. Each operational phase (data collection, ranking, allocation, etc.) is implemented as a round in the FSM, with transitions managed by the AbciApp. This ensures modularity, consensus, and reliable state management across agent instances.

- FSM rounds: DataCollection, Preprocessing, OpportunityRanking, Allocation, Transaction, Tracking, Rebalancing, Reset
- Each round = `AbstractRound` + `Behaviour`
- SynchronizedData ensures all agents share the same state

## Technical Development Plan
### MVP Phase
- Implement core FSM rounds for data collection, ranking, allocation, transaction construction, and monitoring
- Integrate with Fluid Protocol and AAVE V3 for initial data sources
- Gnosis Safe integration for secure transaction execution
- Pearl healthcheck endpoint and environment variable support

### Integration Phase
- Expand protocol support (Compound, Dolomite, Silo)
- Enhance risk management and rebalancing logic
- Deepen Pearl integration (UI, monitoring, dashboards)
- Documentation and user configuration options

## Integration Requirements
- Agent exposes `/healthcheck` endpoint for Pearl
- Reads all configuration from environment variables injected by Pearl (see [Architecture](./architecture))
- State persistence via `STORE_PATH`
- Gnosis Safe for on-chain actions

## Required Environment Variables
- `STORE_PATH`, `ETHEREUM_LEDGER_RPC`, `GNOSIS_LEDGER_RPC`, etc.
- `SAFE_CONTRACT_ADDRESSES`, `WITHDRAWAL_MODE`
- Protocol API keys (e.g., `THE_GRAPH_API_KEY`, `PORTALS_API_KEY`<sub>*MVP Evaluation*</sub>)


## How It All Connects
- The FSM orchestrates the agent's workflow, with each round handling a specific responsibility
- Pearl manages agent lifecycle, injects configuration, and monitors health
- All logic and configuration is designed for seamless deployment and operation on Pearl

See [Architecture](./architecture) for module breakdown and [Milestones](../milestones) for the development roadmap.

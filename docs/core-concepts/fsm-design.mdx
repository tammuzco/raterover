## Overview
RateRover's core logic is orchestrated by a Finite State Machine (FSM) implemented using the Open Autonomy framework. Each round represents a distinct operational phase, with transitions managed by the AbciApp.

## Rounds Breakdown
- **DataCollectionRound**: Fetches raw market data from protocols
- **PreprocessingRound**: Normalizes and enriches data
- **OpportunityRankingRound**: Identifies and ranks arbitrage opportunities
- **AllocationRound**: Decides capital allocation
- **TransactionConstructionRound**: Prepares Gnosis Safe transactions
- **PositionTrackingRound**: Monitors open positions
- **RebalancingRound**: Adjusts positions as needed
- **ResetRound**: Loops FSM for continuous operation

## State Transitions
| From | Event | To |
|------|-------|----|
| DataCollection | DONE | Preprocessing |
| Preprocessing | DONE | OpportunityRanking |
| OpportunityRanking | DONE | Allocation |
| Allocation | DONE | TransactionConstruction |
| TransactionConstruction | DONE | PositionTracking |
| PositionTracking | DONE | Rebalancing |
| Rebalancing | DONE | Reset |
| Reset | DONE | DataCollection |

## Open Autonomy & Pearl Integration
- FSM is implemented using Open Autonomy's AbciApp and AbstractRound classes
- Pearl monitors FSM state via healthcheck endpoint
- All state transitions and data are synchronized for agent reliability

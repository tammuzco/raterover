Welcome to **RateRover** â€“ an autonomous DeFi arbitrage agent for the Arbitrum network, built on the Open Autonomy (OLAS) framework and designed for seamless integration with the Pearl platform.

## What is RateRover?
RateRover is an automated agent that identifies and executes profitable yield arbitrage opportunities across DeFi lending/borrowing protocols. It collects market data, analyzes opportunities, executes transactions, and manages positions, all with robust risk controls.

## Required Environment Variables
- `STORE_PATH`: Directory for persistent agent data (set by Pearl)
- `ARBITRUM_LEDGER_RPC`: RPC endpoints for supported chains
- `SAFE_CONTRACT_ADDRESSES`: Gnosis Safe addresses (JSON)
- `WITHDRAWAL_MODE`: If true, agent should unwind positions
- Any protocol-specific API keys (e.g., `THE_GRAPH_API_KEY`)

See the [Configuration](./core-concepts/architecture) page for full details.

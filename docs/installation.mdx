## Requirements
- Python 3.9+ (see Pearl's `pyproject.toml` for exact version)
- pip
- (Optional) Mintlify CLI for local docs preview

## Python Environment Setup
We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Python Dependencies
Install all required dependencies, including Open Autonomy and Open AEA (see Pearl integration plan for required versions):

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you need to install specific versions (replace with actual required versions):
```sh
pip install open-autonomy==<VERSION> open-aea==<VERSION>
```
